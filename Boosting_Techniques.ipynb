        "\n",
        "A weak learner is a model that is only slightly better than random guessing. In Boosting, the most common weak learner is a Decision Stump—a decision tree with only one split (one node and two leaves).\n",
        "\n",
        "Boosting works by focusing on the \"hard\" cases.\n",
        "Here is the step-by-step logic:\n",
        "\n",
        "Initial Training: You train a weak learner (Model 1) on the entire dataset. It will get some predictions right and some wrong.\n",
        "\n",
        "Assigning Weights: The algorithm looks at the data points that Model 1 got wrong. It increases the \"weight\" or importance of those specific points.\n",
        "\n",
        "Sequential Correction: The next weak learner (Model 2) is trained.7 Because of the weighted data, Model 2 is \"forced\" to pay more attention to the mistakes made by Model.\n",
        "\n",
        "Repeat: This continues for $N$ iterations. Each subsequent model tries to solve the \"residual\" error left behind by the previous ones.\n",
        "\n",
        "Final Combined Vote: To make a final prediction, the algorithm combines the predictions of all the weak learners.10 Models that had higher accuracy are typically given more \"say\" or weight in the final decision\n",
